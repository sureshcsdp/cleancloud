## About the Project

CleanCloud is an actively maintained cloud hygiene engine focused on safe, explainable, read-only detection of orphaned and inactive resources across AWS and Azure.

If you use CleanCloud internally, consider starring the project to help signal demand and guide future investment.

The project is open to:
- Strategic partnerships
- Commercial licensing
- Integration discussions

For business inquiries, please open a GitHub issue with the `business` label.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add docstrings to all public functions

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include tests:

**For bug fixes:**
- Add a test that reproduces the bug
- Verify the test passes after your fix

**For new rules:**
- Add unit tests for rule logic
- Mock cloud API responses (no real API calls in tests)
- Test all confidence levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Test edge cases (empty results, missing fields)

**For new features:**
- Add integration tests if applicable
- Update documentation

### Documentation Requirements

All code changes must include documentation updates:

- Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory
- Add examples for new features
- Update README.md if user-facing changes
- Add entry to CHANGELOG.md (if exists)

---

## Rule Addition Criteria

CleanCloud has strict criteria for new hygiene rules to maintain trust and quality.

### A new rule must meet ALL of:

**1. Read-only operations only**
- No `Delete*`, `Modify*`, `Tag*`, or `Update*` API calls
- Safe to run in production environments

**2. Clear, measurable signals**
- No ambiguous heuristics
- Multiple signals preferred over single indicators
- Age-based thresholds for resources created by automation

**3. Explicit confidence levels**
- Must assign LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH confidence
- Confidence criteria must be clearly documented
- HIGH confidence must have very low false positive rate

**4. Broadly applicable**
- Applies to most organizations (not niche use cases)
- Addresses common pain points
- Provides clear value (time/cost savings)

**5. Conservative by design**
- Prefer false negatives over false positives
- Account for IaC and autoscaling patterns
- Include "why this is safe" documentation

### Rule Proposal Process

1. **Open an issue** with the `rule-proposal` label
2. **Describe the problem** - What resources are orphaned? How common is this?
3. **Explain detection logic** - What signals would you use? What thresholds?
4. **Justify confidence levels** - Why is this HIGH vs MEDIUM vs LOW confidence?
5. **Address edge cases** - When might this produce false positives?
6. **Wait for maintainer feedback** - Rule proposals require approval before implementation

**Example rule proposal template:**
```
**Rule name:** Unused AWS Elastic IPs

**Problem:** Elastic IPs cost $0.005/hour when not attached, accumulating ~$3.65/month per IP

**Detection signals:**
- EIP allocation exists
- EIP not associated with instance or network interface
- Age > 7 days (to avoid catching IPs in deployment)

**Confidence:** HIGH (attachment state is deterministic)

**Edge cases:** 
- Reserved IPs for future use (mitigated by requiring tags to indicate "reserved")
- IPs being used for DNS records (can't detect, requires manual review)

**Required permissions:** ec2:DescribeAddresses
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- ✅ All tests pass locally
- ✅ Code follows style guidelines
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Commit messages are clear and descriptive

### PR Guidelines

**Title format:**
```
[Type] Brief description

Examples:

## Development Tips

### Running CleanCloud Locally

```bash
# AWS scan (uses your AWS CLI credentials)
python -m cleancloud.cli scan --provider aws --region us-east-1

# Azure scan (requires environment variables)
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=...
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=...
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
python -m cleancloud.cli scan --provider azure
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Add verbose logging (if implemented)
cleancloud scan --provider aws --verbose

# Or use Python debugger
python -m pdb -m cleancloud.cli scan --provider aws
```

### Testing New Rules

```bash
# Test single rule file
pytest tests/providers/aws/rules/test_my_new_rule.py -v

# Test with real credentials (use test account!)
AWS_PROFILE=test-account cleancloud scan --provider aws
```
