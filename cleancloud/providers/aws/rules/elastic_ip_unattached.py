    Find Elastic IPs allocated 30+ days ago and currently unattached.

    Unattached Elastic IPs incur small hourly charges when not associated.

    IMPORTANT: AWS does not expose "unattached since" timestamp, so we use
    allocation age as a proxy. An EIP allocated 30+ days ago and currently
    unattached is worth reviewing.

    SAFE RULE (review-only):
    - EIP does not have AssociationId (not attached)
    - EIP allocation age >= days_unattached threshold (NOT unattached duration)
    - Classic EIPs without AllocationTime are flagged immediately (conservative)
