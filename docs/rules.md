# CleanCloud Rules

Complete reference for all hygiene rules implemented by CleanCloud.

---

## Design Principles

All CleanCloud rules follow these principles:

### 1. Read-Only Always
- Uses read-only cloud APIs exclusively
- No `Delete*`, `Modify*`, `Tag*`, or `Update*` operations
- Safe for production environments

### 2. Conservative by Default
- Multiple signals preferred over single indicators
- Age-based thresholds prevent false positives on temporary resources
- Prefer false negatives over false positives

### 3. Explicit Confidence Levels
Every finding includes a confidence level:
- **HIGH** - Multiple strong signals, very likely orphaned
- **MEDIUM** - Moderate signals, worth reviewing
- **LOW** - Weak signals, informational only

### 4. Review-Only Recommendations
- Findings are candidates for human review, not automated action
- Clear reasoning provided for each finding
- No rule should justify deletion on its own

## AWS Rules (6 Total)

### 1. Unattached EBS Volumes

**Rule ID:** `aws.ebs.volume.unattached`

**What it detects:** EBS volumes not attached to any EC2 instance

**Confidence:**

Confidence thresholds and signal weighting are documented in [confidence.md](confidence.md).

- **HIGH:** Unattached ≥ 14 days
- **MEDIUM:** Unattached 7-13 days
- Not flagged: < 7 days

**Why this threshold:**
- Allows time for deployment cycles
- Accounts for rollback windows
- Reduces false positives from autoscaling

**Common causes:**
- Volumes from terminated EC2 instances
- Failed deployments or rollbacks
- Autoscaling cleanup gaps

**Required permission:** `ec2:DescribeVolumes`

---

### 2. Old EBS Snapshots

**Rule ID:** `aws.ebs.snapshot.old`

**What it detects:** Snapshots ≥ 365 days old

**Confidence:**

Confidence thresholds and signal weighting are documented in [confidence.md](confidence.md).

- **HIGH:** Age ≥ 365 days

**Limitations:**
- Does NOT check AMI linkage (by design, avoids false positives)
- Does NOT verify snapshot is unused (conservative approach)

**Common causes:**
- Backup retention policies without lifecycle rules
- Snapshots from deleted volumes
- Over-retention without cleanup

**Required permission:** `ec2:DescribeSnapshots`

---

### 3. CloudWatch Log Groups (Infinite Retention)

**Rule ID:** `aws.cloudwatch.logs.infinite_retention`

**What it detects:** Log groups with no retention policy

**Confidence:**

Confidence thresholds and signal weighting are documented in [confidence.md](confidence.md).

- **HIGH:** No retention policy, ≥ 30 days old

**Why this matters:**
- Logs grow indefinitely without retention
- Can reach GBs/TBs over months
- Often forgotten after service decommission

**Common causes:**
- Default CloudFormation behavior (no retention)
- Manual log group creation
- Missing lifecycle policies

**Required permission:** `logs:DescribeLogGroups`

---

### 4. Untagged Resources

**Rule ID:** `aws.resource.untagged`

**What it detects:** Resources with zero tags

**Resources checked:**
- EBS volumes
- S3 buckets
- CloudWatch log groups

**Confidence:**

Confidence thresholds and signal weighting are documented in [confidence.md](confidence.md).

- **MEDIUM:** Zero tags (always MEDIUM, never HIGH)

**Why this matters:**
- Ownership ambiguity
- Compliance violations (SOC2, ISO27001)
- Cleanup decision paralysis

**Required permissions:**
- `ec2:DescribeVolumes`
- `s3:GetBucketTagging`
- `logs:ListTagsLogGroup`

---

### 5. Unattached Elastic IPs

**Rule ID:** `aws.ec2.elastic_ip.unattached`

**What it detects:** Elastic IPs allocated 30+ days ago and currently unattached

**Confidence:**

Confidence thresholds and signal weighting are documented in [confidence.md](confidence.md).

- **HIGH:** Allocated ≥ 30 days ago and currently unattached (deterministic state)

**Important limitation:**
- AWS does not expose "unattached since" timestamp
- We measure allocation age as a proxy
- An EIP could have been attached until recently (we can't tell)

**Why this matters:**
- Unattached Elastic IPs incur small hourly charges
- State is deterministic (no `AssociationId` means not attached)
- Clear cost optimization signal with zero ambiguity

**Detection logic:**
```python
if "AssociationId" not in eip:  # Not attached
    age_days = (now - eip["AllocationTime"]).days  # Allocation age, NOT unattached duration
    if age_days >= 30:
        confidence = "HIGH"  # Deterministic state: no AssociationId
```

**Common causes:**
- Elastic IPs from terminated EC2 instances
- Reserved IPs for DR that are no longer needed
- Failed deployments leaving orphaned IPs
- Manual allocation without attachment

**Edge cases handled:**
- Classic EIPs without `AllocationTime` are flagged immediately (conservative) and annotated as `is_classic: true` in details
- 30-day threshold avoids false positives from temporary allocations
- Uses allocation age as proxy for unattached duration (unavoidable with AWS API)

**Required permission:** `ec2:DescribeAddresses`

---

### 6. Detached Network Interfaces (ENIs)

**Rule ID:** `aws.ec2.eni.detached`

**What it detects:** Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) currently detached and 60+ days old

**Confidence:**

Confidence thresholds and signal weighting are documented in [confidence.md](confidence.md).

- **MEDIUM:** ENI created ≥ 60 days ago and currently detached

**Important limitation:**
- AWS does not expose "detached since" timestamp
- We measure ENI creation age as a conservative proxy
- An ENI could have been attached until recently (we can't tell)

**Why this matters:**
- Detached ENIs incur small hourly charges
- Often forgotten after failed deployments or incomplete teardowns
- Clear signal with minimal ambiguity

**Detection logic:**
```python
if eni['Status'] == 'available':  # Currently detached
    # Exclude AWS infrastructure using InterfaceType
    if eni['InterfaceType'] not in ['nat_gateway', 'load_balancer', 'vpc_endpoint', ...]:
        age_days = (now - eni['CreateTime']).days  # Creation age, NOT detached duration
        if age_days >= 60:  # Conservative threshold
            confidence = "MEDIUM"  # Medium because we can't measure detached duration
```

**What gets flagged:**
- ✅ User-created ENIs (InterfaceType='interface')
- ✅ **Lambda/ECS/RDS ENIs** (RequesterManaged=true but YOUR resources!) — explicitly annotated in evidence and details
- ✅ Detached ENIs from deleted services

**AWS infrastructure ENIs (excluded):**
- ❌ NAT Gateways (InterfaceType='nat_gateway')
- ❌ Load Balancers (InterfaceType='load_balancer')
- ❌ VPC Endpoints (InterfaceType='vpc_endpoint')
- ❌ Gateway Load Balancers

**Key insight:** `RequesterManaged=true` means "AWS created this in YOUR VPC for YOUR resource" — these ARE your responsibility and often waste. RequesterManaged ENIs are included in findings with an explicit evidence signal and `requester_managed: true` in details for downstream filtering.

**Common causes:**
- Failed EC2 instance launches
- Incomplete infrastructure teardown
- Terminated instances with retained ENIs
- Forgotten manual ENI creations

**Edge cases handled:**
- Uses creation age (60+ days) as proxy for detached duration
- 60-day threshold is conservative to reduce false positives
- Could flag ENIs that were attached until recently (unavoidable with AWS API)
- Flags ENIs without tags (ownership unclear signal)
- AWS Hyperplane ENI reuse behavior listed as signal not checked (undocumented retention)
- `interface_type` and `requester_managed` included in details for CI/CD filtering

**Why 60 days (not 30):**
- We measure creation age, not detached duration
- Longer threshold reduces false positives
- If an ENI is 60+ days old and currently detached, it's worth reviewing

**Required permission:** `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`

- **HIGH:** Unattached ≥ 14 days
- **MEDIUM:** Unattached 7-13 days
- Not flagged: < 7 days

**Detection logic:**
```
if disk.managed_by is None:  # Not attached

- Autoscaling cleanup gaps

**Required permission:** `Microsoft.Compute/disks/read`

---

### 2. Old Managed Disk Snapshots

**Rule ID:** `azure.old_snapshot`

## Rule Stability Guarantee

Once a rule reaches production status:
- ✅ Rule ID remains stable
- ✅ Confidence semantics unchanged
- ✅ Backwards compatibility preserved
- ✅ Schema additions only (no breaking changes)

This guarantees trust for long-running CI/CD integrations.
